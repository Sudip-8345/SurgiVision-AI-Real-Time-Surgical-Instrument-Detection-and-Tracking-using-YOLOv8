# SurgiVision-AI-Real-Time-Surgical-Instrument-Detection-and-Tracking-using-YOLOv8
This project aims to detect and classify surgical tools using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. Whether it is scalpels, tweezers or scissors, the system identifies tools in real-time using a live video feed from camera. The ultimate goal ? Simplifying operations and assisting robotic hands in surgical environments.
